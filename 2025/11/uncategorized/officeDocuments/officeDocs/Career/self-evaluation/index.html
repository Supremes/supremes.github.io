    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In last one year, I learnt and made a lot in our team. I am gradually being a important role in the IOS SH team. I has been picking up tickets, from small issue to critical issue, take initiative to deal with pripority issue and provide valuable thoughts. I would like to look back what I have learnt and achieve in the team.</p>
<h2 id="Epic"><a href="#Epic" class="headerlink" title="Epic:"></a>Epic:</h2><p>For the epic ticket, I take many things (Sort by priority)including:</p>
<p>CXM-108345 Cigna - Improve MDX-to-MAM SDK Experience:  </p>

<p>CXM-108544 RFE ID-014551 - iOS eSim Support</p>
<p>​	This is a issue or request from customer. With this feature enabled, CEM could show all eSIM related properties in device details. Also, I have figured out some deprecated usage in MDM command. Have consciousness that not only complete the feature,  but to perf our code even product.</p>
<p>CXM-110413 Enhancement of SecureHub two factor enrollment</p>
<p>​	This is RFE from priority customer, it improve the user experience on MDM two factor enrollment.Also, it’s a critical issue which need us to make a POC demo in short time. I made this POC demo on time or even ahead of schedule, and output a quality demo. Moreover, it provides guarantee for the subsequent official launch of the product.</p>

<p>CXM-107380 Unable to deploy Webclips on iOS Shared devices using ASM configruation</p>
<p>​	It’s a RFE which is related to Shared iPADs. It supports user channel of Webclip policy in Shared iPAD mode. I have accumulated my experience in Shared iPAD and shared it with everyone in team. Collebrate with CQE college to fix and complete DEP or Shared iPAD related test case issue.</p>
<p>CXM-106120 Deprecate WSH (RPi) support</p>
<p>​	This is a tech debt issue. WSH platform is not supported anymore, and we need to make some change on CEM side. It’s a big thing which I take after joined our team.I get familiar with CEM and accumulated lots of development experience about server. Also, it was delievered in time and quality.</p>
<p>CXM-110876 Deprecate MDX</p>
<p>​	This is a tech debt issue. I investigate all related scenario in MDX deprecation. Sort out a relatively complete scheme to help others to make decision together.</p>
<p>CXM-107727 Add CSG Copyright notice</p>
<p>​	Read and analyze the copyright annouments after our oragnization changed from citrix to CSG. Give a solution(user-defined XCode file header comment) which could update copyright declartion in each file with high efficiency.</p>

<p>​	Groomed mVPN tunnel startup process, and complete validation with the help from other college. Accumulate experience in intune mode and get ready for incoming issue related intune part.</p>
<h2 id="Customer-Issues"><a href="#Customer-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Customer Issues:"></a>Customer Issues:</h2><p>For customer issue below,  I handled prority customer and Severity plus issues. Cooperate with escalation engineer to achieve customer success.</p>
<p>XMHELP-4120 Unable to open intranet site on Secure Web iOS.</p>
<p>Investigate split tunnel mode from code side, CEM and Gateway configuration side. Gave customer a conviceful feedback and help them to configure split tunnel mode in right way. </p>
<p>Summarized a info page to help team better understand how split tunnel mode works in iOS and Android.</p>
<p>XMHELP-4153 ADFS Login to site does not work on Secure Web for iOS</p>
<p>Cooperate with SW team member to look into this issue. It strength me the ability to communicate and collaborate across teams.</p>
<p>XMHELP-4166 Unable to enroll DEP devices when connected to WiFi</p>
<p> It took me long time to find the root cause,  but it broadened my thinking. Don’t get into the weeds. What you think is wrong at first is not.</p>
<p>XMHELP-4171 Endpoint Management | Getting error: “Access to Company Network is not available” in Secure Hub</p>
<p>It’s an un-reproducible case in customer env, and it got a quick closed.</p>
<p>XMHELP-4176 Accessing internet sites using SecureWeb app is slow.</p>
<p>This is from a prority plus customer, I take initiative to make a thorough investigate about this case. With a clear and effective communication way - use flow chart to describle our question and conclusion, at last, we got customer and escalation engineer’s trust, it was cause by customer env which is configured with   a problem proxy.</p>

<p>XMHELP-4326 CEM does not show Rapid Response Update 16.4.1(a) installed</p>
<p>This is from email query firstly, and I make a quick check and validation about that, and let customer to create a XMHELP ticket. At last, it was fixed by some code change happens on MDM command.</p>
<p>XMHELP-4389 Issue with exporting calendar agenda to local calendar from Secure mail</p>
<p>This is firstly handled by SM team, they invovle us a little bit later, and there is not much helpful logs.

Now, I need to stay in communications with escalation engineer and customer more to let them understand this behaviour is not a issue but expected. It practice my ability to communicate across teams</p>

<li>Deliver high quality ouput(listed above) througout my work experience,  it promotes our product quality </li>
<li>With detailed groom process, break down tickets and set priorities, simplify future works. </li>
<li>With continuous delievering results(RFE and Customer issue) to priority customer, it makes customer success.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Is-there-anything-that-would-make-you-more-successful-in-your-role-moving-forward"><a href="#Is-there-anything-that-would-make-you-more-successful-in-your-role-moving-forward" class="headerlink" title="Is there anything that would make you more successful in your role moving forward?"></a><strong>Is there anything that would make you more successful in your role moving forward?</strong></h1><p>After joining citrix, I faced much challenges, including:</p>
<p>Shift of work roles: backend developer to full-stack developer in iOS</p>
<ul>
<li>Through continuous research on product code and related development language(Objective-c and Java) learning, my coding ability and problem thinking ability have been gradually improved. Meanwhile, I I gradually became a role of code quality and CI optimization in a team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adapt to brand new working environment</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting help from my mentor Kun Ma and Other experienced colleague, it accelerated my integration into the team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deal with priority customer RFE</p>
<p>For example: Cigna - Improve MDX-to-MAM SDK Experience. In this case, I have spent much time on investigating MDX and SecureHub and MAM SDK interactions. Because of this, I have a deep understanding of the interaction process between them.Meanwhile, output a quality info page to introduce iOS keychain and MDX-MAMSDK initialization.</p>
<p>Deal with priority customer issues</p>
<p>The process of handling customer cases, including timely feedback, the switch of ticket status, the switch of assignee, and effective communication methods, is a necessary means to deal with customer cases. Through continuous handling of customer cases, I gradually became familiar with this process and formed efficient problem analysis ability</p>
<p>After all those challenges, I learnt a lot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collabrate with colleagues well in kinds of issues.</li>
<li>Ability to develop feature or fix bug in end-to-end side.</li>
<li>Ability to deal with priority customer RFE and issue independently</li>
</ul>
<p>My manager hui.zhang provide much support to me both in work  and life .</p>
<ul>
<li>Help me develop an awareness of how to prioritize and take initiative.</li>
<li>He pointe out a general direction for critical issue including customer RFE and customer issue and my career direction.</li>
<li>He will point out my shortcomings and recognize my advantages, so that I can improve myself</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to thanks kun.ma. He served as my mentor when I joined the company, and continued to provide me with help in subsequent work, so that I could get a rapid promotion in work.</p>
<p>Also, I need say thanks to all iOS colleges, they help me a lot in work.</p>
